<UL>
<LI>A star is a massive, glowing ball of hot gas, primarily made up of hydrogen and helium, that produces its own light through nuclear fusion reactions happening within its core.</LI>
<LI>Stars are celestial objects that can produce their own light.</LI>
<LI> The sun is also a star; the sun's energy and light play one of the key roles in sustaining all forms of life on earth.</LI></UL>

<UL>
<LI>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite.</LI>
<LI>It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), about 30 times the diameter of Earth.</LI>
<LI>Tidal forces between Earth and the Moon have synchronized the Moon's orbital period with its rotation period at 29.5 Earth days, causing the same side of the Moon to always face Earth.</LI></UL>

<H4>VENUS</H4>
<P BGCOLOR="BLUE">
<UL>
<LI>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, known as the "morning star" because it's often visible in the early morning sky; it's the hottest planet in our solar system due to a thick atmosphere trapping heat (greenhouse effect), making a day on Venus longer than a year on Venus; it spins in the opposite direction compared to most other planets, and has no moons or rings.</LI>
<LI>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and the sixth largest planet.</LI>
